# Maui (GPL)

Maui automatically identifies main topics in text documents. Depending on the task, topics are tags, keywords, keyphrases, vocabulary terms, descriptors, index terms or titles of Wikipedia articles.

Maui performs the following tasks:

* term assignment with a controlled vocabulary (or thesaurus)
* subject indexing
* keyphrase extraction
* terminology extraction
* automatic tagging
* concept extraction

It can also be used for terminology extraction and semi-automatic topic indexing.
